version 0.9 (31 May 2010)
  - added support for the itemize, enumerate and description environments.

version 0.8 (24 May 2010)
  - added support for multibib.
  - added a command to indicate your personal homepage (\homepage{url}), as
  requested by J. de Jong and A. Pairet.
  - corrected an alignment bug for text following a \quote with no immediate
  \section, as kindly reported by J. Vermeulen and L. Saliou.
  - corrected a spacing bug when no blank line (or \par) is left after \maketitle.
  Thanks to A. Menzel for reporting the strange behaviour.
  - corrected the alignment of the extrainfo title part when no picture was used,
  as reported by M. Bana.
  - corrected the missplacement of pdf bookmarks as noticed by L. Fortunato.
  - corrected several bugs linked to the code for checking for empty arguments in
  \cventry, as reported by B. Ekran, L. Păncescu and E. Gregorio.

version 0.7 (17 June 2008)
  - corrected an outstanding spacing bug (space between cvlines longer
  than 1 line).
  - removed the need to use \closesection and \emptysection as internal
  tabulars are now always closed. This allows she use of bibliography packages
  such as bibunits. Thanks to S. Busch for pointing out the incompatibility and
  helping testing out the bug correction.
  - changed the definition of \photo: the first (optional) argument should
  give the desired width of the picture, instead of its height
  - corrected an alignment bug for \cvlistitems longer than 1 line, as
  reported by S. Nikolopoulos.
  - deprecated the commands \sethintscolumnlength and \sethintscolumntowidth.
  Instead, just set \hintscolumnwidth to the desired length by using the regular
  \setlength or \settowidth commands, and call \recomputelengths.
  - added the ability to control the width of the name placeholder in the classic
  theme, by setting the length \maketitlenamewidth. Again, don't forget to call
  \recomputelengths afterward.

version 0.6 (28 May 2007)
  - corrected some spacing bugs and cleaned up the code.
  - corrected a bug in the bibliography file of the examples spotted by
  U. Stöhr.
  - added color variants to the classic and casual style, as suggested by
  U. Stöhr.
  - added a page counter for resumes running longer than 1 page, as requested by
  A. Martin. It can be disabled by the command \nopagenumbers{}.
  - added commands to include a mobile phone and fax number.
  - made the symbols used for the phone number, the email, ... customizable.
  To modify those symbols, just redefine \phonesymbol, emailsymbol, ...
  - corrected the pdf information given to hyperref as pointed out by
  C. Knuepfer.
  - rewrote the examples.

version 0.5 (9 September 2006)
  - added a \photo command to display a picture. That command takes the name of
  the file with the picture as argument, and the desired height as optional
  argument.
  - implemented the needed commands to make moderncv compatible with BibTeX, as
  suggested by J. Lie. This makes it possible to display one's publications,
  stored in the BibTeX file 'publications.bib'
  by using:
    \nocite{*}
    \bibliographystyle{plain}
    \bibliography{publications}
  As usual, the name of the section title can be changed by redefining the
  command \refname.
  - added the \today command, useful for example if one need to add the date the
  resumé was produced with
    \closesection{}
    \vfill{\hfill{\scriptsize Produced \today.}}
  at the end of your CV, as suggested by F. Hammann.

version 0.4 (2 May 2006)
  - removed the dependency on the geometry package, so that users can now invoke
  it themselve, and easily change the geometry of the page.

version 0.3 (10 April 2006)
  - moderncv now uses the 'longtable' class, allowing cv sections to split
  across multiple pages.
  - the different lengths used by moderncv are now customizable! In particular,
  the first column (the one containing the date in the examples), can now be set
  to any width, for people needing a smaller or larger one. To do that, either
  use
    \sethintscolumnlength{<length>},
  where <length> is the desired length in a unit LaTeX understands, or
    \sethintscolumntowidth{<string>},
  where <string> is a string of the desired length (usually, the longest string
  that has to appear in the column). Thanks to A. Pöge for pointing out the need
  of such a feature.
  - added the command \emptysection{}, which makes it possible to start a
  section without name. In combination with \closesection{}, this makes it
  possible to drop out of the layout of moderncv, and come back to it later.
  This should make the inclusion of arbitrary elements not covered by moderncv
  code possible.
  - corrected a spacing problem in the cventry command, as pointed out and
  solved by B. Eßmann.

version 0.2 (6 March 2006)
  - rewrite of the code to have the styles (fonts, colours, headers and footers)
  be defined in different files than the class. The styles are now defined in a
  separate file per style, named moderncvstyle<style_name>. It should now be
  easy to write your own style, starting from moderncvstyleempty.sty. If you
  feel you have created a nice style, just email it to me and I'll include it in
  the next version.
  - due to the previous point, styles are now loaded by the command
  \moderncvstyle{style_name}. I couldn't figure out a way to preserve the old
  "casual" and "classic" class options, so these are now broken! Use
  \moderncvstyle{casual} or \moderncvstyle{classic} at the beginning of your
  document. This should be the only incompatibility with version 0.1.
  - added class option "nolmodern" for people without the latin modern fonts.
  - corrected some English mistakes in the examples. Thanks to M. H. Prager for
  pointing them out.
  - added a \cvlistitem to produce items with a bullet (or whatever is defined
  in \listitemsymbol), and renamed \cvresume to \cvlistdoubleitem for
  consistency purpose. For compatibility reasons, the command \cvresume still
  works, but should be avoided.

version 0.1 (1 March 2006)
  - first release.
